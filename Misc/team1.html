<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>Some of the ethical issues I am concerened about when to comes to Ai becoming involved in the fast food industry is the fact that human workers loose jobs as the AI replaces them. This is not good as when workers become jobless they cannot earn money that is needed to feed them selves or live thier normal life. If Ai replacing human workers in the fast food industry becomes a huge trend It can also be bad as many people will loose thier jobs as many people work in fast food resturants wich can lead to a significant rise in uneployment wich can contribute to poverty wich is also not good and to a lack of jobs for them to get in to. It can also be bad as due to more people ending up in poverty as a result of these major job losses people may turn to crime to simply live or to make money. Therefor an increase in uneployment may lead to an increase in crime wich is not good for the local community as crime can de value the local area such as houses as no one wants to live in a crime ridden community. Another intresting ethical issue when It comes to Ai in the fast food industry Is who is to blame when somthing goes wrong. With a human worker it is simple and easy to blame the error on the worker as the worker is the one who for example undercooked the chicken. When It comes to Ai who do you blame. Do you blame the Ai itself. Do you blame the person who trained the Ai or do you blame the person who codded the Ai. It is this lack of understanding of who is responsible wich is not a good thing as this may make it harder for the staff or the company to find the issue and correct it meaning that the company may fail to make the wrong choice and the problem will continue resulting in more angry customers wich can lead to bad ratings for the fast food resturant.</p>
